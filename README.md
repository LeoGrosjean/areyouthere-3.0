Our module permit us to check if a student is in front of the camera or not.

We take a picture every 5 secs. We use the API Faceplusplus to make the facial detection. We put a red or green signal to symbol the presence.

Installation : Log as administrator on moodle. Load the zipped module as a block plugin. Install it. Add the block and put the right position.
